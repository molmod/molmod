"""Collection of routines to handle computational chemistry file formats

   It is not the intention to duplicate the work done in the OpenBabel project.
   Several file formats below are rather specific for molecular dynamics
   simulations and not all of them deal with representing molecular systems. The
   scope is more generic. The selection of supported formats is purely driven
   by the convenience of the MolMod developers.
